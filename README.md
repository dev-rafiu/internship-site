# First commit

An online platform where developers can look for internships both on-site and remote.

This projects was assigned to me by the CTO of ViztaEdu. ViztaEdu is a social media-based educational mobile and web-based app for tertiary-level students to learn,network and impact. The purpose of the project was to add a good project to my resume.

Initially I did not enjoy the project but after adding some functionalities, I enjoyed working on it.

When the app loads, users are required to log in if they have an account or create new account if they do not have an account.

When logged in,users can see the avalilable internships which some of them are real internship opportunities from linkedIn.

Each internship has a title, name of the company, and a details link to check the details which includes summary,description, and qualifications.
Users can click on the apply link which sends them to an external resource.

I used React, react-router-dom, Firebase Authentication (for users to sign up and log in), Css, bootstrap, js file that contains array of internship data.
