# First commit

An online platform where developers can look for internships both on-site and remote.

This projects was assigned to me by the CTO of ViztaEdu. ViztaEdu is a social media-based educational mobile and web-based app for tertiary-level students to learn,network and impact. The purpose of the project was to add a good project to my resume.

Initially I did not enjoy the project but after adding some functionalities, I enjoyed working on it.

When the app loads, user is required to log in if they already have an account or create new account if they do not have an account.

When logged in,user can see the avalilable internships which some of them are real internship opportunities from linkedIn.

Each internship has a title, name of the company, and a details link to check the details on a different page which includes summary,description, and qualifications.

User can click on the apply link which directs them to linkedIn or another webpage where the internship was orijinally posted to apply.

I used React, react-router-dom, Firebase Authentication, Css, bootstrap,a js file that contains array of internship data.
